1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
Ladies and gentlemen, Liz Garvey,
Director of Communications.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,050
First day, exciting.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,100
'The age of information
control is over.'

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:12,130
~ The commissioner saw her TED talk.
and his dick went hard.
~ I trust you, Liz. ~ Yes Commissioner.

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,090
It must be quite a culture shock,
from working for a website to a job
where lives are on the line.

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,290
I give her six months
and she's scrambled eggs.

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,090
~ Was there an intent to fire?
~ I didn't know the suspect's weapon
was a replica.

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,730
Since the incident the important
thing is you feel fit to continue.

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,250
~ Shooting in the
Wandsworth Road area. ~ We're on it!

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,730
ARMED POLICE!

11
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,850
The thing about you, Warwick, you do
shoot unarmed members of the public.

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,410
~ OK, guys. Your turn with filming.
~ We have got Robbie with us.

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,050
~ Keep an eye on him, right?
~ Step away from the fucking lamppost!

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,410
What do you think about Robbie's
application for firearms training?

15
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,970
~ Think he's got what it takes?
~ I will verbally dominate you.

16
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,210
No, no. It's different.

17
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,250
These shootings could be linked.

18
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,010
However, Scotland Yard
is still to make a statement.

19
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,010
The news media is like a crocodile.

20
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,370
Unless you throw them a piece
of meat, they go a bit nuts.

21
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,730
~ Just tell them the truth. ~ Which is?

22
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,370
This is so far off the record,
even I don't know I'm saying it!

23
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,570
Why'd you go behind my back
to The Mirror?

24
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,330
You tried to fuck me
and I'm not having it.

25
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,690
~ We've got him. ~ Could be hostages.
Could be anything.

26
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,890
~ The shooter's been tweeting. ~ Shut it
down. ~ Twitter or the whole internet?

27
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,330
You can't take control.
That is the reality.

28
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,930
~ Warwick, are you set?
~ Can we clarify before we go in?

29
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,970
~ Don't go in. ~ We have gone in!

30
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,010
~ He's out the back.
~ Warwick, are you on it?

31
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,130
I've got him.

32
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,730
ARMED POLICE!

33
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,770
Shooter's dead.

34
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,930
Congratulations on a good job well
done with supreme professionalism.

35
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,130
~ Couldn't get a close sight.
~ Front page.

36
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,890
Doesn't look great, eh? I'm sorry
your first day was such a fucker.

37
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,610
~ Exciting though, eh?
~ It was exciting!

38
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,810
~ Oi! ~ We are in charge.
~ Fuck off! ~ That is the message.

39
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,490
This is a new game and we are
playing for keeps.

40
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,540
~ You need me. ~ I need you gone.

41
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,170
Are you losing control,
Commissioner?

42
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,610
I don't answer that sort
of question.

43
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,570
A year ago, Commissioner, you
promised new faces, a new approach.

44
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,530
But on corruption,
on racial diversity,

45
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,130
on the use of lethal force,
it's business as usual, isn't it?

46
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,170
Uh-uh. Next question.

47
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,530
You've not had a kiss of the Blarney
Stone this morning, Commissioner.

48
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,050
~ What exactly have you been kissing?
~ Excuse me?

49
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,010
Well, have you been kissing
the arse of the Home Secretary?

50
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,810
Have you not had your hands down
a number of big boys' trousers,

51
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,970
~ looking to keep them sweet?
~ Yeah, all right, Tom, knock it off.

52
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,130
Commissioner, you've got to respond.
Just let him have it.

53
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,290
No. I have not been tugging off
politicians for influence.

54
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,530
Changing times. New ideas.
Big challenges.

55
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,850
London is safe. Big Ben's on time.

56
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,090
The Beefeaters are fucking
the ravens. All's well.

57
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,890
~ Thank you and good morning.
~ Commissioner, I think you need to...

58
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,530
Thank you. Incredibly useful.

59
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,970
I have always rehearsed
my CEOs for big set pieces

60
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,010
and it has always been beneficial.

61
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,250
Today's hearing with the
deputy mayor will be tough.

62
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,970
~ You need a new strategy.
~ I have a strategy for the committee.

63
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,610
~ I give them nothing.
~ Yeah, that's passive and defensive.

64
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,130
~ Things are changing.
~ Everything's always changing.

65
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,170
I remember when it was Monday,
now it's Tuesday.

66
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,810
Yeah, don't patronise me,
Commissioner.

67
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,810
You are very plausible
when you come out fighting.

68
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,850
You don't like a question
that was asked?

69
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,170
Paraphrase it to answer one
we do like. Basic, yeah?

70
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,220
OK. Fair dos. Point taken.
Excuse me, I have a lot on my plate.

71
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,210
Two steaks, fish supper and a Subway
foot-long shit sandwich on my plate.

72
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,730
I understand.
All I'm saying is we should be like,

73
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,090
"Hold on. Didn't order
the shit sandwich."

74
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,850
~ If you give me the time
I can help you. ~ Sure, OK.

75
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,370
Let's schedule 20 minutes
before the committee, Tom.

76
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,050
And what about you, Liz?
Settling in OK?

77
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,850
Yeah. Good. My refrigerator is...

78
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,250
You don't need to know this,
but it buzzes like, "zzz",

79
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,650
~ really loud while I'm trying
to sleep. ~ OK, that's bad.

80
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,700
~ I'll be round at 2200 hours
to fix it. ~ Oh, well...

81
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,490
~ I don't know if that would be...
~ I'm joking, Liz.

82
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,050
Right.

83
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,100
No, me too.

84
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,780
~ Oh, my God! ~ All right.
So girls, girls. Fuck work...

85
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,650
Hello, pavement!

86
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,050
Mia, hey!

87
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,010
~ Liz! Brilliant! You came?
~ Erm, yeah, are you kidding?

88
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,060
~ I... you said, so I thought...
~ Ladies, I give you Liz Garvey.

89
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,930
~ Head of Communications at Scotland
Yard. ~ Oh, fuck that shit.

90
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,810
~ I'm just Liz.
~ Get another one down you, boss.

91
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,610
So, presumably you do know other
people in London?

92
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,210
Oh, yeah. Loads.

93
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,450
Well, some.
One, really. Er... a guy.

94
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,170
I don't know what went on.
I guess he was a boyfriend.

95
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,410
So, what, did he head-fuck you?

96
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,530
He was more of a fuckhead,
than a head-fuck.

97
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,730
~ Oh, a head-fuck and a fuckhead.
~ Hubba-hubba!

98
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,970
Can I have his number?

99
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,850
You are welcome to it!

100
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,890
It's like, why are we even
in communications? Is she OK?

101
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,010
Because we are
in an information revolution.

102
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,610
~ If it was 1815 we'd be running
the rail roads. ~ Yeah.

103
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,410
It's like the footage of the
police shooting at the takeaway.

104
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,650
~ Don't embargo that,
put it out there. ~ Yeah.

105
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,490
Ask Joe Public,
what would they have done?

106
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,810
I mean, that's a huge
perception shift.

107
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,570
It's really, really, interesting(!)

108
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,620
And the commissioner, it has
to go from him grilling me
to me preparing him.

109
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,290
He's a brand and he's reluctant to
sell himself because he's a part of

110
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,330
"generation reluctant to accept
the commodification of the self",

111
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,570
like that hasn't been happening
since Napoleon.

112
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,620
And I am talking so much work shit
on your one night off
and I need to stop.

113
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,610
Liz, fuck work...

114
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,660
Hello, pavement!

115
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,690
~ Hmm. ~ That's not so bad.

116
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,810
~ And this is live, is it? ~ Ow.

117
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,130
It's pretty much live.
There's a three minute delay or so.

118
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,010
~ But it's great function, isn't it?
~ Brilliant function.

119
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,930
It's all part of our
Securamax service.

120
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,290
Also nice to think
he's probably over the worst.

121
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,340
~ It was three minutes ago.
~ Yeah, he'll be fine. Is he?

122
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,940
OK, it's not nice but bottom line,
is it a riot?

123
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,530
Because our view,
and I've had this direct from HQ,

124
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,370
is that it's not a riot.

125
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,170
Well, it's a disturbance. It's
definitely a disturbance, I'd say.

126
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,290
No-one's saying it's not a
disturbance. Disturbance is fine.

127
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,450
Look, I don't want
to put pressure on you.

128
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,410
Terms of Securamax contract,
I'm asking you.

129
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,460
If it's a riot, we say it's a riot,
and the firm takes a hit.

130
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,650
In my opinion, what we're looking
at here is a severe disturbance.

131
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,700
~ Quite. It'll burn itself out.
~ It is tiring, fighting.

132
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,220
Yeah, the arms will tire eventually.

133
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,170
Drop the weapon!
Drop the weapon!

134
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,650
~ Hi, Warwick. Sorry to keep you
waiting. Liz Garvey. ~ Hi.

135
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,530
So, the reason I've got you
in to see me is because it involves

136
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,210
the incident you were involved in,
the discharging of...

137
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,690
~ When I shot that bloke.
~ Exactly, when you shot that bloke.

138
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,730
So the footage of it gives
a really good vibe

139
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,490
of how it must have felt to you.

140
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,010
Before I give it to news agencies
I want you to watch it here

141
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,330
with me to be sure you're
comfortable with it.

142
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,730
~ I shot him. I think I can cope,
Ms Garvey. ~ OK, great.

143
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,970
Then I'll just take a look.

144
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,010
Armed police! Armed police!
Drop the weapon! Drop the weapon!

145
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,250
I'm going to stop
it before it gets to the...

146
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,290
~ Oh! ~ Fuck!

147
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,170
Sorry, I missed it.
We'll pixelate, obviously.

148
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,010
Why? Is that to protect me
or just cos I'm so ugly?

149
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,170
Look, some people don't trust us.

150
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,450
They think we've a bunch of trigger
happy meat-heads on the team.

151
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,850
But this took judgment and skill.
It looks great for us.

152
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,570
~ That's why I want to put this out.
~ Shame he didn't have a gun.

153
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,610
Yeah, well. It looks like
he had a gun.

154
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,130
Yeah, see? That's what I thought.

155
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,690
We've been getting emergency calls
from the surrounding housing.

156
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,130
The residents near the prison
are beginning to panic.

157
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,010
~ What's going on in there? ~ I don't
want to go into too much detail. ~ No?

158
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,290
And I don't want the GP
to put that brush up my vagina

159
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,330
when I get my smear test
but that's the procedure.

160
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,380
We're not currently requesting
police assistance under
the terms of our contract.

161
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:41,180
We have officers at the heart
of the disturbance,
ready to reassert total control.

162
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,300
And out of interest, why don't they?

163
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,580
Uh-huh. Well, what's on fire?
No people are on fire, are they?

164
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,180
Sure. No, I get it.

165
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,210
It has become necessary
to request assistance.

166
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,260
~ Yep. Hmm-mm. ~ Yeah.

167
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,890
Tom, can you get into my diary?
All my medical appointments

168
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,490
- doctor, physio -
can you delete them?

169
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,540
Can I technically, or ethically,
or physically? What's the question?

170
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,090
No, sure. Very good.
And can I ask why?

171
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,730
~ Yes. For a reason. ~ Excellent.
Thank you.

172
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,570
And you don't want to ask your
secretary yourself?

173
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,620
I don't want it to happen. I just
want it to have happened. All right?

174
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,370
Disturbance at Craven Wood
Youth Offenders.

175
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,170
Securamax were trying
not to trigger penalties.

176
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,050
~ But now they're calling us in.
~ Everyone all right? Guards, kids?

177
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,170
Yeah, minor injuries. I'd like to
deploy TSG for perimeter control

178
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,690
and potential intervention
assistance.

179
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,810
OK. Deploy the reserve.

180
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,530
With all due haste bearing in mind
our other responsibilities.

181
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,570
Absolutely, Commissioner. Fuck them.

182
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,770
~ Will you get down there, Sharon,
make sure it plays right? ~ Sure.

183
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,820
Tom, get me Liz.

184
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,050
~ Now good? ~ Yeah, good. Come in.

185
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,100
~ I just wanted to catch up.
Have a seat. ~ Hmm-mm.

186
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,690
OK, look, Finn.

187
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,330
I know I took your job
but I am not going to pretend.

188
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,890
~ I don't like you.
~ It's great to see you too.

189
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,330
~ And you don't like me.
~ Only everything I know about you.

190
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,770
You know, Adolf Hitler would
sometimes appoint two people to do
the same job.

191
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,610
Then he'd just see who was best,
who fought it out.

192
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,210
~ Great manager, great guy.
~ What I'm saying is let's not fight.

193
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,170
Yeah? Let's harness
our different talents.

194
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,050
OK, Liz. Can I just be really open
and honest with you?

195
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,770
An interesting question,
you've never previously tried.

196
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,890
It was hard for me
when I didn't get the promotion.

197
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:59,210
You're funny, you're good
at the job, you're talented,

198
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,170
you're young, you're v- ... very
attractive...

199
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,690
You had me at "good at the job".
Let's do it right here.

200
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,410
And things have been hard
for me and Sarah.

201
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,410
She wants to be in the country,

202
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,490
she wants to be in a bigger
house in the country.

203
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,730
The commute's killing me,
then, suddenly, bang!

204
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,770
~ She hates the country. ~ That's hard.

205
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,250
I mean, it's not Gaza,
it's Hertfordshire. But, still.

206
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,300
So, yeah, maybe off the back of that
I have been a little...

207
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,370
.. brittle.

208
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,370
But, yeah. Let's give it a go, yeah.

209
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,420
Yeah. OK.

210
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,650
~ Bad news, mate. ~ What?

211
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,130
You got a bounty on your head.

212
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,730
What?

213
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,970
Yeah, Catford mob have put
a bounty on you, mate. A grand.

214
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,050
~ What? ~ It can't be true -

215
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,410
I don't think there's
a grand in the whole of Catford.

216
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,250
Yeah, sorry, Warwick. That bloke
you put out of the picture -

217
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,770
Brother-in-law thinks he's wide.

218
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,450
He's not. He's just some pub
arsehole.

219
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,650
Apparently they got wound
up by the video.

220
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,530
It's up?! How did it...? Already?

221
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,050
Internet, mate -
It might be the new thing?

222
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,850
Brilliant(!)

223
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,890
I hope they put a link up to me
house on Google Maps and all.

224
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,290
A grand? I'd pop you for a tenner.

225
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,770
Always the way, mate.

226
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,250
In the orchestra of life
SC019 are the piccolo players -

227
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,890
always getting
fucked by the top brass.

228
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,010
Tony, that is profound... ly shit.

229
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,130
Fuck off.

230
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,180
I'm going to put a fucking
bounty on your banter, mate.

231
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,170
So, Robbie, will there be a big
bastard anvil

232
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,690
cracking your head like a melon?

233
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,330
Or a Samurai sword up your jacksie?

234
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,650
I'm laughing(!) I actually find this
really funny(!)

235
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,730
~ Come on, guys give me more(!)
~ Oh, you're definitely going to die.

236
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,170
Prison riot, plus it's your last day
before you head off

237
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,250
for weapons training, mate.
It's guaranteed.

238
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,690
Could it be one of those really sad,
weird ones?

239
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,850
Dickhead throws a brick, you duck,
wasp flies in your mouth,

240
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,210
stings you and your throat
closes up.

241
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,450
Or a nutjob ties your dick in a knot

242
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,970
and you drown in piss
from the inside.

243
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,650
Can we get a move on? It's going to
take hours at this rate.

244
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,810
No drama.

245
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,370
Nope. No lights - that's the order.

246
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,970
Looks like a long one.
Hard on the family, is it?

247
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,690
What are you missing out tonight,
then?

248
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,740
Um, feet in the foot spa,
curry on the lap.

249
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,940
Me?
Um, Tuesdays I'm swimming, normally.

250
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,970
Hey, Robbie. Got a message for you,
mate. "Good luck tonight.

251
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,770
"See you down the prison riot.

252
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,090
"I'm going to do you with a broken
bottle. Love, the Grim Reaper."

253
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,770
I don't understand it.
Does it mean anything to you?

254
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,650
You're a funny guy, ain't you(?)

255
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,090
Well, police officers are now
arriving

256
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,650
at the Craven Wood Youth Offenders'
Institution after what we believe

257
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,050
to be an outbreak of rioting.

258
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,410
Now, Securamax - that's the company,
the security company,

259
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,610
that holds the contract
to police this institution -

260
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,660
they're the ones that called in the
police to try to calm the situation.

261
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,970
We've also had reports
of people being held hostage

262
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,410
inside the institute, but as of yet
these reports are unconfirmed.

263
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,330
Just to let you know, Richard
wanted to put something out on this.

264
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,450
You?

265
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,250
Or you. You were on a call.
I'm telling you now.

266
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,450
OK. What?

267
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,290
Just the line on the riot.
"We're here when needed."

268
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,370
Subtext - we don't have an axe
to grind on privatisation.

269
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,050
But, poking a cheeky nipple
out of the top of the subtext -

270
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,810
Do you really want to
privatise the cops?

271
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,010
End up with some knobhead in a bib
letting Al-Qaeda

272
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,330
play swing ball with
a nuke around Nelson's Column?

273
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,380
Please don't use the word "nipple"
around me. I find it offensive.

274
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,290
I'm sorry.

275
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,340
I'm fucking with you, Finn.
That sounds good.

276
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,210
I don't know. Are people going to
make the connection?

277
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,890
Because this is
prison privatisation - not police.

278
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,610
First they came for the prison
service and we didn't give a shit

279
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,410
because they're wankers. Then they
came for the traffic wardens

280
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,570
and everyone was still very much,
"Meh - fuck 'em."

281
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,410
And then they came for us, and there
was no-one left to give a toss.

282
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,770
All right, but I only trust you, me,

283
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,330
or Mia to deliver that
line to the media.

284
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,930
Teamwork.

285
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,010
It's a great time to get the private
sector to back off, by the way.

286
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,050
Rumour has it Securamax are trying
to poach some of our top talent.

287
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,130
Can't have people robbing
from the police, now, can we?

288
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,410
Do you think
I have a particular stance?

289
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,850
Like, the way my knees go?
I'm distinctive, aren't I?

290
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,890
Not really, mate.

291
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,090
Just the hard-on before you shoot
unarmed members of the public.

292
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,970
'Trojan 133.
To confirm, lone, armed male.

293
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,450
'Bishop's House, Wandsworth,
third floor.

294
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,330
'IC1 caller described
it as an Uzi-type shotgun.'

295
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,250
Trojan 133. On it.

296
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,250
Uzi shotgun? Fucking hope not.

297
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,300
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
A trap.

298
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,610
A trap - because?

299
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,850
Well, they're not going to hit me in
Catford, are they? It's too obvious.

300
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,250
Oh, right. No, sure, mate. No.

301
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,300
Let's, er...
let's keep an eye out on that front.

302
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,930
Everything seems to be
quietening down.

303
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,930
We think it's going
to burn itself out.

304
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,370
~ I don't think we have any such
intelligence.
~ That's not what I'm hearing.

305
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,010
Fine, well, let's just make sure
we're on the same page.

306
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,090
We at the Mayor's office would love
to have a clear communications

307
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,970
message on the root of all this.

308
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,610
Briefing against
the private sector -

309
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,770
does that look
like you're picking a fight with us?

310
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,090
Ah, they've twisted that.

311
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,770
I'll get on them. That's bad.

312
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,850
Thank you. Obviously, we don't have
an axe to grind,

313
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,090
but it would be great to get a
senior face out there just squashing

314
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,490
any notion that privatisation
or staffing is the root cause

315
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:32,540
of the disturbance at Crane
Wood Youth Offenders' Institution.

316
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,450
Agreed.

317
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,050
Well, I... can do that.

318
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,100
Securamax staffing levels are not
an issue, as far as we're aware.

319
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,770
~ Ma'am, the inmates say they have the
guards hostage. ~ And do they?

320
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,530
Well, they have people
in a secure room.

321
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,730
The firm say the staff
are monitoring the inmates,

322
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,370
but the inmates are of the view
that the staff are hostages.

323
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,130
~ Is it airtight?
~ It may not be airtight, but,

324
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,570
I mean, what can they do -

325
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,290
suck all the air out with a straw?

326
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,930
Fart them out?

327
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,530
~ What's that coming underneath
the door? ~ Yeah. What is that?

328
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,650
'Lighter fuel.
They said it was lighter fuel.'

329
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,370
~ Get out of there. Get out of there.
~ Is it definitely...? Hold on.

330
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,650
~ 'Open the door!'
~ No. Can you taste it?

331
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,530
Wait. It's water. It's water!

332
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,650
Oh, fuck!

333
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,090
Oh, good. Yeah, they're in.
That's great. Well done.

334
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,050
Hmm.

335
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,730
I'm sorry, ma'am.

336
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,090
And a swift end to this
is what we're all hoping for.

337
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,290
Lid on press. Boot up the kids.

338
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,970
You know, Finn, you're all over
this.

339
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,650
Why don't we get you down on
the scene,

340
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,770
make sure everything stays nice and
tight? I want my best brain on it.

341
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,930
And regarding this...

342
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,930
Interesting ideas.
Let's keep working on that.

343
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,980
Thank you.

344
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,090
(Thank you. We managed quite well there.)

345
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,650
Looking forward to getting your
hands on a weapon, Robbie?

346
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,970
Can't wait. But right now
it's all about the nuggets.

347
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,530
Everyone's got to do the 100
nuggets on their last day, Matt.

348
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,330
Right, come on. Get those
chicken arseholes down you.

349
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,330
Matt, a quick word?

350
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,650
Yeah, have a look at that first.

351
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,610
~ Is that it? ~ Oh, that's easy, is it?
~ Of course.

352
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,850
So how you doing so far -
got much usable?

353
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,450
Er, bits and bobs, you know.

354
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,410
That stuff - "Tuesday nights,
boring night" - any good to you?

355
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,370
Er, I don't know. Maybe, maybe not.

356
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,290
Don't take the piss.
That is NOT a nugget factory.

357
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,490
There's nothing.
I'm worried about it, technically.

358
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,610
Whether it's too dark.

359
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,690
I'm concerned regarding the light.

360
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,740
~ Mate, what? ~ Oh, fuck off, then.
~ Clarkey, what...?

361
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,290
Look, mate, it's Davina.

362
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,170
Apparently she's got a cheeky one.

363
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,370
She's on a foreigner.

364
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,970
She's riding someone?

365
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,570
Yeah! And Tuesday night's ride night,
apparently.

366
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,730
She tells her old man
she sees her sister,

367
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:48,490
but she panicked on camera, and...
she can't even swim.

368
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,530
So it's a bit of an issue,
her saying swimming.

369
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,130
Oh, right, right. Who's she riding?

370
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,010
I don't know. Some hunk of spunk.

371
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:59,650
So, for her, can you cut it?

372
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,700
Mm.

373
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,490
Look, I mean,
that's just random nastiness now.

374
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,490
'The situation is definitely tense,
and it's not clear

375
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,410
'whether the inmates have
any specific demands.

376
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,010
'It's also not clear
whether the situation was made worse

377
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,010
'by the fact that Securamax -
now, that's the company

378
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,250
'in charge of running the institute,
are understaffed,

379
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,530
'or whether this was just
a spontaneous outbreak of violence.

380
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,050
Mm-hm. Yep. Yeah. Patrick and

381
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,130
the Mayor are very keen to be kept
abreast. Is it resolved yet?

382
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,850
Yes. You can tell them
I've sorted it.

383
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,850
Ooh. We've sorted it, apparently.

384
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,410
He says, "Cool. Brilliant."

385
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,170
Yes, I've agreed they can have
a 24-hour titty bar and a rock

386
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,810
of crack the size of Gibraltar.
Is that "cool"?

387
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,530
No. He's joshing, Patrick.

388
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,730
That was... That was pure josh.

389
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,330
Um, but the headline is, "We'll
let you know." That was the...

390
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,690
that was the point of josh.
We'll call you. Cheers, mate.

391
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,970
'Of course, there will be an enquiry
but, at the moment,

392
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,090
'we cannot pinpoint any spark.
To the best of our assessment,

393
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,650
'Securamax were doing a good
job at this facility.'

394
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,290
Yeah, so he's been sounded out
to join Securamax.

395
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,970
'Anyone who says otherwise really
should wait..."

396
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,250
Charlie?

397
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,890
Who, Charlie?

398
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,250
How did you get this?

399
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,130
I know their head of recruitment
from business school.

400
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:24,180
Inglis has been to their Glasgow
headquarters three times.

401
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:29,010
Oh, Charlie. You've dipped your dick
in the Moulinex now.

402
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,060
'Thank you very much.'

403
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,080
Can you look after the car,
please, fellas?

404
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,270
Armed police!
Can you open up for me!

405
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,150
Everything's fine, thanks.
There was a man, but he's gone.

406
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,670
I'm fine now, goodbye!

407
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,350
I need to see you!
Can you open up for me, please?

408
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,350
Hello?

409
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,710
Armed police.

410
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,710
We need to search the premises.

411
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,070
If you do not respond we are
going to have to make a forced entry.

412
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,510
Can I have a word?

413
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,590
You all right, mate?

414
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,110
I've got this chair from one
of those online things.

415
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,310
I can't put it together.
I don't think they put er...

416
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,510
What's that thing that's
not a screwdriver?

417
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,830
An Allen key?

418
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,470
No, not that.

419
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,750
So I want to make a complaint.

420
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,390
~ Front door! ~ Let's have it.

421
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,790
I'll lock down this
whole situation, yeah?

422
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,670
They messed up
my prescription at Londis.

423
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,230
They don't pay any duty
because they're Poles.

424
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,280
Stop or we'll shoot!

425
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,350
Armed police!

426
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,750
Stop!

427
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,070
Armed police! Stop! Fuck's sake.

428
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,790
Come here. Come here.

429
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,150
Fucking arsehole.

430
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,200
Good luck, pal(!)

431
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,920
Unarmed male heading out of
Bishop's House towards A23.

432
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,510
His head's not right, man.

433
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,790
Who? Warwick?

434
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,840
The bounty's given him the yips.

435
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,630
They've got hostages.

436
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,830
What are they saying?

437
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,350
'This is Guard Gabriel Peters.

438
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,830
'The message I have from the inmates
is that they wish to speak to

439
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,510
'Holly Willoughby.'

00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,310
~ We're working on it.
~ We're working on it.

441
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,110
'And they want pizzas.'

442
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,910
Joey Barton's said on Twitter
he's willing to be an intermediary.

443
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,630
'They say that
if they don't get pizza,

'up the anus and
cook us and eat us.'

446
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,430
Tell them we would advise
against eating a guard.

447
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,870
Look, we'll get you some pizzas.

448

'They say they want naan breads.
And onion bhajis.

'Hold on,
I'm getting lots of requests.

'Stuffed crust.'

452

Not stuffed crust.
That's taking the piss.

453
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,790
'They say no anchovies or
someone lose their finger.'

454
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,070
Did they say that?

455
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,910
'Yeah!'

456
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,710
OK. Sit tight. Tell them
we're sending in pizzas.

457
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,470
We need to make
an intervention plan.

458
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,910
I've received a credible threat.

459
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,670
Stuffing him with cheese
and eating him?

460
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,990
~ No cheese could realistically be
inserted up an anus. ~ I don't know.

461
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,430
Reckon I could do it with a wedge
of Parmesan and a lump hammer.

462

'Fucking hell. Fucking time wasters.
Fucking hell. Step away from the...

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,870
All right, guys?

467
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,350
So, listen, we were very excited

468
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,590
with the off-the-record
material you sent us.

469
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,990
~ Yeah? You liked it?
~ Oh, we loved it, Matt. Yeah.

470
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,190
What we were wondering,
was whether or not

471
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,240
we could get hold of not just
a copy, but the original material?

472
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,950
~ Yeah? Why? ~ To look at it more.
Properly. The original.

473
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,110
I mean what were your
plans for it, Matt?

474
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,830
All right, look. Here's my thinking.

475
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,070
I get together enough material
of Robbie off the cuff

476
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,790
and I basically
put together a feature.

477
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,470
Directed by me, produced by you.
Indie shit. Under the radar.

478
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,550
We break out.
Sundance, festivals, online.

479
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,190
Bang. The real story.

480
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,150
~ OK, I have a thought...
~ Yeah, I have a thought.

481
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,550
Cool, I'll put my thought on ice.

482
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,630
My thought is
this is fucking bullshit.

483
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,550
You're grabbing your hair, cutting
your neck, pulling your head off

484
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,750
~ and going, "Look what I've done."
~ That is a concern.

485
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,630
But we're happy to
talk about it, aren't we?

486
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,870
To be honest. No.
No, I don't want to talk about it.

487
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,550
I want you to delete it.

488
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,710
The police lay us golden eggs
every day.

489
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,910
Rule one -
do not fuck the golden goose.

490
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,390
You know, you hump the golden goose,
you're going to get golden egg

491
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,230
on your dick, smashed.

492
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,150
You know, same pipe...

493
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,200
probably. Isn't it?

494
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,110
Sure. No, I get it. Yeah.

495
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,160
Course you do.
Because you're a fucking grown-up.

496
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,710
Hey, Finn.
We're about to go into committee.

497
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,070
~ Everything tight?
~ Yeah, Liz. No worries.

498
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,830
We on message? Situation stable.
Anything I need to know about?

499
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,630
No, it's definitely still
going to be all going on here
when he's in front of the committee.

500
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,350
Yep. Sharon's playing a blinder.

501
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,550
I've got the line.

502
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,310
Yeah, laters.

503
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,830
All right, hi, sorry.

504
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,830
So, joint Prison Service
and Police operation

505
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,590
in conjunction with Securamax.
Everything's going smoothly.

506
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,750
And what's the timeframe.
You going in soon?

507
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,230
Yeah, we're going in at exactly...
Fuck off, Harry.

508
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,070
Operational details
are confidential.

509
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,630
~ But between us?
~ Can you piss off to the pub? No.

510
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,990
Will we go in right away?
No. No. The assessment is not.

511
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,470
What's the background?

512
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,710
They're bad lads. But we can cope.
Off the record? Deep background.

513
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,110
Personal opinion -
definitely not a MET briefing -

514
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,870
the private outfit
are a shower of shite.

515
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,630
The mayor's pushing
to go in way too soon.

516
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,590
Good bloody job we're here to hold
things steady. But that's just me.

517
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,350
~ Any colour for us? ~ They want
to talk via Holly Willoughby.

518
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,270
~ We're sending some pizzas in.
~ What toppings?

519
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,320
I don't bloody know.
Martha, what toppings?

520
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,430
Er, a few margheritas,
a few ham and mushroom.

521
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,150
~ Here, feast on that, John Pilger.
~ What sort of ham?

522
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,350
Oh, I see. Yeah. Regular, basic ham.

523
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,390
All right?
We're not pampering these lads.

524
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,440
Headline for me is "Cool Heads
Of Police Hold The Line."

525
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,400
But that's just me.

526
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,710
Liz.

527
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,230
Liz, just a quick
one on the down low.

528
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,230
But I'm a little bit
concerned there might be

529
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,230
~ an issue around Richard's health.
~ Yeah?

530
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,390
Yeah. He's eager to
keep something quiet.

531
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,630
And I think it's beholden on us,

532
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,470
Gaddafi's Amazon Virgins

533
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,350
so to speak, to try to keep him
out of stressful situations.

534
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,110
~ Out of stressful situations? ~ Yeah.

535
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,750
He's the head of London police, Tom.

536
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,990
His scrotum is
the mayor's stress ball.

537
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,630
Your briefing notes, Commissioner.

538
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,390
Commissioner.
Normal stone-wall on policy, is it?

539
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,510
Just facts and figures?

540
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,950
Yeah, just a quick one,
Charlie, in case it comes up.

541
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,710
~ I'm not going to find you jumping
ship in the next 12 to 18 am I? ~ Eh?

542
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,760
What's this nonsense?

543
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,870
I've signed nothing with anyone.

544
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,510
OK, well I'm finding this
increasingly reassuring.

545
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,510
What if I refuse to
incriminate myself?

546
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,630
What if I went a bit 1970
West Midlands Serious Crime Squad

547
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,680
and asked you to come
for a walk with me?

548
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,910
Look, Richard, off the record,
I'm in a tough spot.

549
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,710
You're in situ. You're not
going anywhere, thank God.

550
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,430
And I don't want to go to
West Mercia, hunting paedos

551
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,150
and sheep rustlers,
I want the top job,

552
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,110
but sometimes you wonder if your
face fits, you know what I mean?

553
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,750
So, yes, in my shoes,
wouldn't you be tempted?

554
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,950
Don't play me like a fucking prick.

555
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,950
I'm sorry?

556
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,070
I'm talking quietly now because
I do not want to lose my temper.

557
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,230
Well, I appreciate that.

558
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,830
We put you up to deliver a line
which backed a private company,

559
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,390
who in my personal opinion are
a bunch of trouser-stuffing,

560
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,510
arse-licking,
penny-pinching clown-fuckers,

561
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,830
and they want to come after
a slice of my pie, all right?

562
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,870
~ Well, I think that's a bit harsh.
~ Yeah, well.

563
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,670
You were the face of this force.

564
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,590
~ What if you go and someone makes
the link? ~ That's not going to happen.

565
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,790
Thanks for looking into
your crystal fucking ball.

566
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,070
But why don't you sit on it?
Cos here's the thing -

567
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,670
I'm on 24-hour-a-day storm watch,
yeah?

568
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,720
I sleep like a cokey meerkat on an
electric fence - that's me relaxing.

569
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,510
I've got a map inside my head
of all the trouble in the world

570
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,070
and you just popped up on
the radar like Godzilla's hard-on.

571
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,070
And I will cut you loose
and watch you burn if you

572
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,120
ever, ever fuck me again,
Charlie, all right?

573
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,550
Commissioner. How are you?

574
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,030
Your boys took a bit of a beating
in mid-week, didn't they?

575
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,630
Have you got your shin pads,
Charlie.

576
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,590
Deputy mayor's mob need
you for centre-half.

577
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,640
Yeah.

578
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,680
Break-out. Inmates are through in
a cordon and heading for perimeter.

579
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,590
We're launching the drone
for perimeter surveillance.

580
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,230
Drone now activated.
And airborne.

581
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,230
Nugget 41.

582
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,830
Oh, the 42nd nugget
is the hardest nugget.

583
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,710
They call that one The Wall.

584
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,750
'All TSG units.
Break-out assistance required.'

585
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,390
464. Got it. That's us.

586
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,350
~ Break-out.
~ All right, you heard the man.

587
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,950
Are you serious? I'm on 42 nuggets.

588
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,910
That's got to be at least
two chickens. I'm halfway!

589
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,270
Break-out, break-out, break-out.
Perimeter fence north.

590
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,270
Ten or more young offenders
over the fence.

591
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,320
Repeat - break-out, break-out,
break-out. Perimeter fence north.

592
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,550
IC1, IC3, IC4 males scattering now.

593
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,550
Breaking north, east and west.
Immediate action. All TSG...

594
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,230
Good afternoon, Commissioner.

595
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,030
And welcome to the Mayor's
Committee on London Policing.

596
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,230
And can I just start by asking
you to acknowledge that the great

597
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,280
force you lead today probably
commands less trust than it

598
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,070
has ever commanded
in its whole history?

599
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,550
It's very nice to see you too.

600
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,190
And given that state of affairs,
as most people see them,

601
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,110
can I just ask your personal
opinion on some police functions

602
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,630
being operated under
contract by private firms?

603
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,430
You'll understand if I don't
get into policy discussions.

604
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,750
And is that just your
fancy way of saying no?

605
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,350
Because this committee is tired
of you saying one thing in public

606
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,550
and another in private.

607
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,710
Oosh! That's what I said to my ex.

608
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,310
I made him cry in the end.

609
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,350
If you want an example
of us doing our job

610
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,310
and the private sector doing theirs,

611
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,230
~ then Craven Wood
at this very minute... ~ Yes.

612
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,910
Are you aware there's been
a break-out through police lines

613
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,230
at Craven Wood Youth
Offenders Institution?

614
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,070
~ Is that true?
Why don't we know that? ~ Uh...

615
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,110
I can't comment
on operational matters.

616
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,230
No.

617
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,550
Why hasn't this prison riot
been resolved yet?

618
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,790
Well, I think I just answered that.

619
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,110
That's like a French 14-year-old.

620
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,270
Are you perhaps letting
this disturbance continue today

621
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,990
in order to pursue a personal
campaign against privatisation

622
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,030
in the public service?

623
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,790
~ No. ~ Got to hit back on that.

624
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,510
Right, we're off perimeter
and looking for the break-out.

625
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,560
Don't know who or how many,
so take it easy, yeah? Pairs.

626
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,990
Robbie, wait up!

627
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,590
Yeah, jog on!

628
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,070
Yeah, Robbie. I reckon
I know how you're going to die.

629
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,030
Shitting a chicken torpedo.

630
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,990
Commissioner, privatisation
of non-core operations

631
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,230
will make your force more efficient.
And if you don't embrace it, well,

632
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,510
police stations will
close under your tenure.

633
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,870
Police officers will lose their
jobs and all because you refuse

634
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,550
to allow your force to
move into the current century.

635
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,600
And I think it's time you
stepped up or stepped down.

636
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,910
I'm sorry,
do you want me to respond?

637
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,430
I didn't think there
was a question there.

638
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,790
Funny?

639
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,070
No.

640
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,990
Fuck. Matt!

641
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,270
Matt... Matt, hel... Matt, help me!

642
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,320
Argh!

643
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,470
Boom! Sit down.

644
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,750
On the floor. Hands out.
There we go, sunshine.

645
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,270
I fucking have you.

646
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,590
Argh!

647
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,640
Thanks for helping me!

648
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,710
Move the fucking camera!

649
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,110
Jesus Christ.

650
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,830
Very well handled. Couple of issues.

651
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,350
He shafted me with a scaffold pole.

652
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,270
Just have a few deep breaths,
Commissioner.

653
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,910
Shut up, you fucking yoghurt.

654
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,590
Nothing personal, Richard.
It's just the agenda. No offence.

655
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,640
Well, it's fine, Grant. None taken.

656
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,110
It's just a situation. It will pass.
Relax.

657
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,430
Relax? Here's what I want done.

658
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,430
I want Grant Delgado stripped jack
naked and I want his bollocks nailed

659
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,430
to the wall and I want to see him
spin by them like a Catherine Wheel.

660
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,630
~ No. ~ I should have been
prepared for that.

661
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,310
~ I tried to prepare you. ~ Not enough.

662
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,630
There's a couple of kids
who need medical attention at

663
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,470
the Institution, sir. Sharon wanted
to let you know we're going in.

664
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,910
If you go in now it looks
like you're caving to Grant. Yeah?

665
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,030
So we let the kids
bleed out for the big win?

666
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,630
~ I'm just telling you how
it will play. ~ Thank you.

667
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,680
We're going in.

668
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,590
I was filming, mate. Doing my job.

669
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,510
It was two against one.
We could have had him.

670
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,830
I'm not a cop. It was one
against one, and one other one.

671
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,790
First rule of Fight Club, if there's
a fight, you're in the Fight Club.

672
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,790
So start punching someone,
you fucking bitch.

673
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,110
David Attenborough wouldn't

674
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,670
stop filming to help an antelope
getting mashed up by a lion.

675
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,030
But he wasn't a lion. I'm the lion.

676
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,390
And I was doing my job.

677
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,470
A proper job.

678
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,990
What?

679
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,470
This is a proper job.

680
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,230
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, course it is.
What, media wanker, is it?

681
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,030
Don't worry about us. We're just
the meat you throw in the machine,

682
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,430
we're the ones who get chewed up.

683
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,430
"Oh, look there's a gap in the wall,
there's shit pouring through.

684
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,480
"Don't worry, we'll just stuff
some fucking cop in there."

685
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:18,120
If I get my spare battery,
could you say that again?

686
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,750
All right. Tornado have requested
assistance. Joint operation.

687
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,710
Full kit, long shields.

688
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,230
Brass are sending us in.

689
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,230
Well, I guess this is it, Rob.

690
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,270
You're bound to cark it - sod's law.

691
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,030
Hope you don't mind
if Clarkey isn't a coffin-bearer.

692
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,550
Yeah, dicky back.

693
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,950
Plus, I never liked you.

694
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,720
Finn, Richard got side-swiped. He
got fucked by a big, boring ninja.

695
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,630
'Yeah, uh-huh?'

696
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,670
Listen, the line to take on
Grant Delgado is that he's anti-cop.

697
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,950
That he's lost it.
That he's a bottom feeder.

698
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,430
Hold on a second.

699
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,390
~ Hello? ~ 'Yeah, hello. Ms Garvey?'

700
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,190
~ Yeah, who is this? ~ Just want to let
you know it's been a great day.

701
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,110
Thanks for putting the
shooting out there.

702
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,430
And I've got a bounty on me head
now, so that's exciting, isn't it?

703
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,750
Yeah, if I go down, well...

704
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,710
you've got blood on
your hands, haven't you?

705
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,760
So, yeah, have a good one.
All right? Cheerio.

706
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,510
Right you are. We're on it.

707
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,670
So we've got an injured
horse in Dulwich Park.

708
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,470
Vet's stuck in the south circular.

709
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,590
Yeah, we're going
James Herriot death squad.

710
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,640
Spring Watch 2 - The Reckoning.

711
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,550
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

712
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,430
I honestly didn't think she'd come.

713
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,630
Will you just say sorry
to them for me?

714
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,270
No, she's fine, she's nice.

715
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,670
Stop laughing. I like her, I do.

716
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,190
I'll just tell her that
Gina's birthday's cancelled.

717
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,190
I'll have a lunch
with her or something.

718
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,910
We'll have an Evian and talk
about 360-degree communication.

719
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,960
Yeah. All right, then.

720
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:08,580
Reporting restrictions are in place
regarding the ongoing operation

721
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,570
here at the Craven Wood
Youth Offenders Institute.

722
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,890
What's going on, Finn?

723
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,890
~ Where are my pictures?
We're going in, yeah? ~ Yes.

724
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,090
Yes, so I want to see
our guys doing their stuff.

725
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,610
'I need the world to see us
saving the day from these
Securamax pillow-fuckers.'

726
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,650
Yeah? Let a news crew film the
preparation for a live operation?

727
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,010
I really need it, Finn.
Help me out on this one, yeah?

728
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,250
What, so inside they can get
the garrottes ready?

729
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,850
I think they know we're coming, so...

730
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,810
This is
operationally sensitive, Liz.

731
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,650
My, what big words you use.

732
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,970
I want those pictures.

733
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,210
No, I'm on the ground.
I'm making a call.

734
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,810
Yeah, and I am the boss
and this day has been fucked

735
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,490
and I want my going-home present.

736
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:47,170
And so does Richard,
so fucking deliver. Good night.

737
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,410
With reports of
serious injuries inside,

738
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:52,890
it looks like the authorities
are saying enough is enough.

739
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,930
From the north, Team Tornado
are coming in and behind me here

740
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,650
you can see the Police
Territorial Support Group...

741
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:02,450
'And behind me here you can see
the Police Territorial Support Group

742
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,330
'gearing up for an intervention.'

743
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,410
Fucking baton bullshit.

744
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,530
This time tomorrow,
it'll be bullets all the way.

745
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,770
No tomorrow for you, mate.

746
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:18,820
They're gonna shave you
and shag you to death.

747
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,730
OK, visors down.
Keep it tight. Work as a team.

748
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:26,780
In we go.

749
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,130
Police sources are telling us
that because of their tactics

750
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,210
and their expertise, they don't
really think many of the inmates

751
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:40,260
are going to put up
much of a fight, if any at all.

752
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:44,780
Come on!

753
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,810
Come on, then!

754
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,130
Come on!

755
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:54,180
Here we go!

756
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,010
Reports of friction over

757
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:00,130
the timing of this operation between
the police and the Home Office

758
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,130
have been described
as "way off the mark".

759
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,570
Meanwhile, I am assured that
the violence now has been subdued

760
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,330
and what's happening right now

761
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:12,290
is being described as "mopping up
the last trouble-makers".

762
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,050
Forward!

763
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,810
Forward!

764
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,130
Ow! Fuck!

765
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,210
Man down! Rob's going down!

766
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:26,260
~ You all right, Robbie?
You all right? ~ Yeah! Course.

767
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:37,220
Get back! Get back!

768
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,770
Stay down.

769
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,370
Police sources have assured me
that the operation

770
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,690
has been swift and effective.

771
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,210
As order is restored
here at the facility,

772
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,930
a growing number of critics

773
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:52,970
are already saying that today's
events call into question any future

774
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:57,020
plans for more private prisons and
crucially, more private policing.

775
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:02,020
Fuck yes!

776
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:06,170
Let's take the trigger to trigger.

777
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,290
Tesco's! Incoming delivery!

778
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,330
I hope it doesn't give me long face.

779
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,130
Look are we doing this?
Yea or "nei-ei-eigh?"

780
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,890
No need to shoot the stable door

781
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,490
after the, er,
horse has been bolted.

782
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,570
Hmm...

783
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,010
Nah, no.

784
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:23,610
I can see what you're going for,
and fair dos, but...

785
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,450
no.

786
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,370
So, Warwick. Are you all right
to slot the gee-gee?

787
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,090
Tony don't fancy it.

788
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,730
~ Yeah. ~ Probably one of his exes.

789
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,010
Got to know her on a dark night
on the Highlands

790
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:38,060
over a can of Tennent's Super
and a deep-fried ketamine.

791
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,210
Yeah, all right. Sure.

792
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,370
This should do it.

793
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,890
A fucking horse, though?

794
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,940
A horse is a thing, mate.
That's the problem, shooting things.

795
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,210
Good man. How did it feel?

796
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,050
Yeah. Just...

797
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,490
Nothing.

798
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:18,540
~ Exactly. ~ Precisely.

799
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,450
Well, guess this is
farewell, dickheads.

800
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,010
We're so happy you're pissing off

801
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:27,060
~ we got you a "thank God
you're pissing off" present. ~ Yeah?

802
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,530
Oh, I love it.

803
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,130
~ Come here. ~ Good luck, mate. ~ Cheers.

804
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,050
Good luck, fanny-face.

805
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,210
~ Cheers, mate. ~ Yeah, very nice.
Can't wait to see you down training.

806
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,810
~ Filming you with your Glock
in your hand? ~ Is that right?

807
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,970
Don't say anything. Have a think.

808
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,130
Oh, I've had a think
and I'm thinking...

809
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,930
fuck you!

810
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,410
See you later, Mr Bystander!

811
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:55,250
~ Nobbo! ~ Come on, you faggot!
Let's get you down to the pub, hey?

812
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,530
I thought you were
gonna leave me in there.

813
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:01,210
~ They'd have had you. ~ I know. I know.

814
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,570
~ Look, I had a word with Matt.
I think we're safe. ~ Good. ~ Yeah.

815
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:08,330
But let's just give it a miss
tonight, eh?

816
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,610
All right, dickhead?

817
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,810
You all right, knobhead?

818
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,730
~ You not seeing your sister? ~ No.

819
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:25,780
No, too late.

820
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,130
Who's that? Did you buzz anyone in?

821
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:44,180
You didn't?

822
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,050
Hello? Who's that?

823
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,690
Delivery.

824
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:01,740
Hold on, mate.

825
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,930
How'd you get in?
Who the fuck are you?

826
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:11,210
~ Who sent you? ~ Warwick! Warwick!
It's OK, I buzzed him in.

827
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:15,260
I'm sorry.
The lads said it was a surprise.

828
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:21,340
Erm...

829
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,090
Here, take that.

830
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:29,140
Sorry, mate.

831
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,810
Oh, fuck. Fucking hilarious.

832
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:38,650
So, how do we think it went today?

833
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,970
Tough committee hearing.

834
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,930
But police pulled the fat out of the
fire at the riots. Good pictures.

835
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,890
No comeback to the Deputy Mayor.
Nice move.

836
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,890
Well, we could have emptied the
files, but we're not the Stasi, so...

837
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,850
No. We're the holy choir
of St Fuck Us Please Priory.

838
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,050
We tell the truth.

839
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,050
And we tell the truth
and we tell the truth.

840
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,330
We're playing the long game.

841
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,610
Fucking long. When do
we get the reward, in heaven?

842
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:00,050
"Here lies Richard Miller,
disgraced in his lifetime,

843
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,250
"now well respected
here on Moon Base Alpha."

844
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,810
I don't know how long, but
I know it's the only game in town.

845
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:09,370
Trust is all you have and
it leaks and it leaks and it leaks

846
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,610
and it never comes back, and
one day, if you piss it all away,

847
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:15,050
you put your foot on the gas
and there'll be nothing.

848
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,250
Doors won't open. Mouths stay shut
and then the whole thing collapses.

849
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,010
Liz, your transparency bollocks
put officers in danger today.

850
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,250
Finn, you lack focus.

851
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,650
You let your emotions
override your decision-making

852
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:28,700
and if you were any good
you would have my job. Richard?

853
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:34,220
I'll walk you out.

854
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,770
You're a fake. You took my tip
on Inglis and Securamax

855
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,330
and passed it off as your own.

856
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,490
Don't stay too late tonight,
will you?

857
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:46,450
I am sure your wife is fucking
everyone in your sad, little village.

858
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,210
Thanks. She's fictional, so...

859
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,130
That figures.

860
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:53,770
~ Good night. ~ Good night.

861
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:56,130
The deputy mayor hurt me
this afternoon, Liz.

862
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,010
We can't have many days like today.

863
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:01,530
You can't stop bad news, Richard.
I thought we agreed on that?

864
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,290
Do you know what 98% right is
in here?

865
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,010
Big fucking story in the 2%. Huge.

866
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,690
We have to get it all right,
all the time.

867
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:11,090
We can't relaunch, move to India.

868
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:14,570
We have to repair the engine while
it's still running at full throttle.

869
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:17,530
We have to change and stay the same.

870
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,570
That's obviously impossible.

871
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,650
Oh, yeah, it's impossible. No-one
tell you that at the interview?

872
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:26,700
It's definitely fucking impossible.

873
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:43,250
'Yo, it's Granger.
You know what to do.'

874
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:47,770
Hi, Granger, you big dope. It's Liz.

875
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,370
Garvey.

876
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:53,420
I know that we haven't spoken
for years, but, erm...

877
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:58,410
I just wanted to call to say hello.

878
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,410
So... hello.

879
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:04,850
And, erm, give me a call some time,
maybe.

880
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:07,010
Or not.

881
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,090
Don't. Probably.

882
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:13,140
